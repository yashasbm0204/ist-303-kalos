## 2. Concept for the Application
We propose developing a **personal finance management application** that allows users to track their expenses and income, set budgets, and monitor savings goals. The application will provide a clear overview of money-in/money-out and offer visualizations to help users make better financial decisions.

## 3. Relevant Stakeholders
- **End users**: individuals who want to log their purchases, income, budgets, and savings targets.  
- **Project developers (our team)**: responsible for designing, coding, and testing the application.

## 4. Initial Set of Project Requirements (User Stories with Estimates)

### User Story 1: Expense Tracking
- **As a user**, I want to input my purchases and categorize them,  
  so that I can see the total of what I’m spending my money on.  
- **Estimate:** 3–4 hours  
  *(design and implement input form, category options, and basic reporting dashboard)*  

### User Story 2: Income Tracking
- **As a user**, I want to input my income,  
  so that I can calculate the total money-in/money-out for a given time period.  
- **Estimate:** 2–3 hours  
  *(simple form + calculation logic)*  

### User Story 3: Budgeting
- **As a user**, I want to create a budget,  
  so that I can track my expenses against my planned predictions.  
- **Estimate:** 4–5 hours  
  *(budget creation interface, logic to compare actual vs. planned spending, and reporting)*  

### User Story 4: Savings Goal
- **As a user**, I want to set a savings target for a product or goal,  
  so that I can track my progress toward achieving it.  
- **Estimate:** 3–4 hours  
  *(goal input form, progress bar visualization, and basic notification/alert feature)*  

### User Story 5 (Optional Extension): Data Visualization
- **As a user**, I want to view charts and summaries of my spending habits,  
  so that I can better understand and adjust my financial behavior.  
- **Estimate:** 4–5 hours  
  *(implement graphs, summary statistics, and filtering options)*

**Note:** These estimates are preliminary and may be refined as the project progresses.
