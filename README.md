## Application Concept
We are developing a **personal finance management application** that allows users to track their expenses and income, set budgets, and monitor savings goals. The application will provide a clear overview of money-in/money-out and offer visualizations to help users make better financial decisions.

## Relevant Stakeholders
- **End users**: individuals who want to log their purchases, income, budgets, and savings targets.  
- **Project developers (our team)**: responsible for designing, coding, and testing the application.
